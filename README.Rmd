# eaCatcheR

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The eaCatcheR R package provides an interface to data from the environment.data.gov.uk catchment planner, which is a resource for various spatial and ecological datasets on waterbodies in England. The package contains three main functions: `get_wb_rnag()`, `get_wb_classification()`, and `get_wb_sf()`, each of which allows you to access data based on geography type (e.g. RBD, MC, OC) and the name of the geography you wish to search.

## Installation

To install the package, you can use the `install_github` function from the `devtools` package:

``` r
devtools::install_github("natehseehan/eaCatcheR")
```

## Example

To use the package, you can use the following code to download data:

```{r example, eval = FALSE}

library(eaCatcheR)

# Get water body RBD data
wb_rnag <- get_wb_rnag("RBD","<water_body_name>")

# Get water body classification data
wb_classification <- get_wb_classification("MC","<water_body_name>")

# Get water body SF data
wb_sf <- get_wb_sf("OC","<water_body_name>")
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:
